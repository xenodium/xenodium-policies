# A fair refund policy.

Bad refund policies are infuriating. You feel like the company is just trying to rip you off. We never want our customers to feel that way, so our refund policy is simple: If you’re ever unhappy with our products* for any reason, just contact [our support team](mailto:support/@/lmno.lol) and we'll take care of you.

Please keep in mind we're a tiny independent team trying to build a sustainable service without any advertising, user tracking, selling user data, or any other shady practice. If you identify with our cause but simply didn't user our product, consider your paid fees enabled us to fund our cause for that period of time.

## Get in touch

At the end of the day, nearly everything on the edges comes down to a case-by-case basis. [Send us a note](mailto:support/@/lmno.lol), tell us what's up, and we'll work with you to make sure you’re happy.

**This policy applies to any product created and owned by XENODIUM LIMITED.**
